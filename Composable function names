The compose function that returns nothing and bears the @Composable annotation MUST be named using pascal case. Pascal case refers to a naming convention in which the first letter of each word in a compound word is capitalized. The difference between pascal case and camel case is that all words in pascal case are capitalized. In camel case, the first word is not capitalized.



The Compose function: 
MUST be a noun: DoneButton()
NOT a verb or verb phrase: DrawTextField()
NOT a nouned preposition: TextFieldWithLink()
NOT an adjective: Bright()
NOT an adverb: Outside()
Nouns MAY be prefixed by descriptive adjectives: RoundIcon()


Example code. Do not copy over


// Do: This function is a descriptive PascalCased noun as a visual UI element
@Composable
fun FancyButton(text: String) {


// Do: This function is a descriptive PascalCased noun as a non-visual element
// with presence in the composition
@Composable
fun BackButtonHandler() {


// Don't: This function is a noun but is not PascalCased!
@Composable
fun fancyButton(text: String) {


// Don't: This function is PascalCased but is not a noun!
@Composable
fun RenderFancyButton(text: String) {


// Don't: This function is neither PascalCased nor a noun!
@Composable
fun drawProfileImage(image: ImageAsset) {
